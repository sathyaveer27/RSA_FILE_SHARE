# secured_messenger

Idea was to build a messenger which would 
send and receive messages using TCP(Transmission control Protocol) 
and secure it with RSA public private keys. 

We initially thought of implementing it in Python,
but then we did it in C language because,
that way you would get to know how data structures
work more accurately. 

For example we had problem of varibles which 
we needed to handle for each type of data

The Rivest–Shamir–Adleman encryption algorithm 
is one of the best algorithm of cryptography.

And that supported with TCP creates the best messenger
which is well secured.
